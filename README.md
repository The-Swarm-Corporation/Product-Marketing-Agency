class ImageType(Enum):
    MASTER_PRODUCT_SHOT = 1
    WHATS_IN_THE_BOX_FLAT_LAY = 2
    EXTREME_MACRO_DETAIL = 3
    # ... and 7 more specialized types
```

### Product Profile Structure

```python
@dataclass
class ProductProfile:
    product_name: str
    category: str
    key_features: List[str]
    accessories: List[str]
    objectives: List[str]
    suggested_image_types: List[int]
```

### Multi-Agent Workflow

1. **Product Analysis**: Initial agent analyzes product characteristics
2. **Strategy Planning**: Marketing strategy agent determines optimal approach
3. **Specialized Generation**: Individual agents create type-specific content
4. **Quality Assurance**: Review and refinement process
5. **Output Optimization**: Final formatting and delivery
